<p>Thank you for choosing Mid-City Smiles Family Dentistry. Our primary mission is to deliver the best and most comprehensive dental care available.

<p>●Cash, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover Card or Check (per approval) ¹ </p>



<p>●We offer a 5% courtesy accounting adjustment to patients who pay for their treatment with cash or check prior to completion of care for treatment plans of $500 or more. </p>

<p><strong>INSURANCE </strong></p>



<p>Our patients are our first priority and we want to assure that you get the highest standard of care at Mid-City Smiles.&nbsp; We are excited to inform you that we have begun working with the insurance companies to renegotiate fees and assure that the services provided in our office are processed at the maximum benefit for our patients and doctors.&nbsp; In the meantime, you may receive a letter from your insurance company stating a change of network status as things get updated.&nbsp; Don’t worry, WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING ALL INSURANCE PLANS AND FILING ALL CLAIMS FOR OUR PATIENTS!*&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>



<ul className="dcsUl">
<li><em>We will continue to file your insurance claims and accept payments directly from carriers. The deductible and coinsurance are your responsibilities, although in many cases your total out-of-pocket amounts may not change or may be less.</em></li>



<li>You can DEFINITELY continue to receive your dental care at our office!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>If you have any questions, we would love the opportunity to review your plan with you and make sure that you fully understand how this might or might not impact you.&nbsp; We are also available to discuss your specific treatment plan, if you are still in the middle of completing your outstanding treatment.</em></li>



<li><em>&nbsp;We appreciate your loyalty, and hope that this has only a positive impact on your dental care.&nbsp;</em></li>
