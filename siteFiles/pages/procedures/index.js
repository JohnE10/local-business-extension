<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Anesthesia</span></strong>&nbsp;– The majority of anesthesia offered at our office is&nbsp;local anesthetic.&nbsp; This means the anesthesia is given as an injection in the area of the mouth where work is being done.&nbsp; Prior to administering local anesthetic, we apply a&nbsp;topical anesthetic&nbsp;to the gum to numb the area where the injection will be given.&nbsp; This is standard procedure at our office.&nbsp; We also offer&nbsp;Nitrous Oxide anesthesia, also known as “laughing gas.”&nbsp; This anesthesia is very useful in relaxing the patient.&nbsp; The patient can elect to choose Nitrous Oxide, but there is an additional fee.</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Bridges </span></strong>– &nbsp;A&nbsp;bridge&nbsp;is a permanent dental restoration.&nbsp; This means it is cemented into place and cannot be removed.&nbsp; It is used to replace a missing tooth/teeth.&nbsp; A bridge involves preparing healthy teeth on either side of the area of the missing tooth/teeth.&nbsp; These prepared teeth serve as anchors for the permanent bridge.&nbsp; Most bridges are made of a base metal covered by a tooth colored porcelain made to look like natural teeth.&nbsp; In order to properly maintain a bridge, a special type of flossing apparatus is required known as a floss-threader.&nbsp; It is very easy to use and the dentist or hygienist will go over it with you.</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Cleaning/Prophylaxis</span></strong> – A dental&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;is often referred to as a&nbsp;prophylaxis.&nbsp; This procedure is usually performed by the dental hygienist or in many cases, by the dentist himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cleaning at our office generally consists of a gentle scaling of the teeth above the gum line, flossing between all teeth and polishing the surfaces of the teeth in order to remove stains.&nbsp; For younger patients, at or below the age of 17, we also administer&nbsp;<Link href="http://midcitysmiles.com/procedures.html#13">fluoride</Link>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Crowns </span></strong>– Crowns&nbsp;are sometimes referred to as “caps”.&nbsp; Crowns are placed on teeth for a number of reasons.&nbsp; On our back teeth or molars, crowns are indicated for teeth that are brittle or broken down, teeth that have very large fillings, and teeth that have previously been treated with root canal therapy.&nbsp; Crowns are used for the same reasons on our front teeth and in addition may be used for cosmetic reasons like covering intrinsic staining (i.e. tetracycline), closing large gaps and covering teeth that may be misaligned.&nbsp; On our back teeth the crowns are almost always made of a metal substructure covered by&nbsp; tooth colored porcelain and made to look like a natural tooth.&nbsp; In some cases, on our front teeth all- porcelain crowns may be indicated.&nbsp; These all -porcelain crowns are more translucent and therefore give a more natural looking appearance.</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Crown Lengthening</span></strong> – Crown lengthening&nbsp;is a surgical procedure which adjusts the position of the gum around the affected tooth. It provides a more solid tooth on which to anchor the restoration of choice, usually a crown.&nbsp;</p>



<p className="has-text-align-center"></p>



<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Dentures</span></strong> – A Complete&nbsp;Denture&nbsp;takes the place of all the patient’s natural teeth. An Overdenture attaches to the roots. The roots serve as an anchor for it.&nbsp;A Partial Denture replaces only a few missing teeth and remaining teeth anchor it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Extractions </span></strong>– An&nbsp;extraction&nbsp;is the term used for the removal of a tooth from the mouth.&nbsp; Extractions are only indicated as a “last resort” for teeth that have no other remedy.&nbsp; In our office patients are given detailed instructions after the actual extraction is performed.&nbsp; These instructions are listed below. </p>



<ul className="dcsUl"><li>Rinsing &amp; Gargling:&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Do not rinse or gargle. This will damage the blood clot that has formed in the tooth socket. The clot is nature’s bandage and protects everything below itself. But, for the first three days the blood clot is like a very weak piece of jelly. It can be easily lost by rinsing or gargling. The danger with this, is when the clot is lost, another will not form. Therefore, there is no protection from food, germs, and saliva getting down into the socket and causing a jaw infection. If the blood clot is&nbsp;protected this will not happen.</li><li>Smoking: No! Do not smoke for three days. The smoke is not the problem. But taking the “drag” causes suction on the clot and the clot can be lost as a result. Again, this means no protection for the socket and jaw.</li><li>Activity: Rest and relax today. No running up and down stairs, no bowling, dancing, etc. or other physical activity. Tomorrow you can start to get gradually back into your normal activities.</li><li>Eating: Your regular diet is okay. But eat smaller bites and eat on the opposite side. Only one caution — No hot liquids for three days. No coffee, tea, soup or cocoa. Hot liquids can dissolve the clot. You should go on a soft food diet only if you&nbsp;find that your regular food is difficult to handle.</li><li>Cleaning:  Gently clean the tongue, lips, cheeks and other teeth to keep the mouth fresh. Use a toothbrush and a mouthwash. No Toothpaste! Toothpaste thickens the saliva. Your natural reaction is to rinse, but remember—rinsing can damage the blood clot. So use Mouthwash, and not toothpaste.</li><li>Sensitivity: Mild pain may be experienced after the anesthetic wears off. Tylenol handles this sensitivity well. Do not use Aspirin. Aspirin promotes bleeding. If you need any stronger medication, we will give you a prescription.</li><li>Bleeding: Bite on the gauze for one and a half hours. A small amount of post-op bleeding can be expected. This is seepage. An extraction creates an open wound and seepage from it is common. Seepage is very different than hemorrhage. A hemorrhage is gross uncontrolled blood flow and it is extremely rare.</li><li>Swelling: Swelling is not uncommon and need not cause alarm. To limit any swelling apply an ice bag or zip-lock baggie filled with cracked ice over the affected area on and off every ten minutes for five hours only.</li><li>NOTE:&nbsp; Often, patients do not want to disturb us at home for their needs. Please do not feel this way. Call for any need. This&nbsp;office does not give medals to heroes. If you have any questions or concerns outside office hours, please call us at home. A one or two minute phone&nbsp;conversation can save hours of unnecessary worry.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Fillings</span></strong> – Fillings&nbsp;are one of the most common procedures done at a dental office.&nbsp; A filling is necessary once decay (a cavity) is present in a tooth.&nbsp; The procedure consists of the dentist gently removing the decay or an old filling with decay around it, then placing a new filling.&nbsp; This is usually done with the help of a dental assistant.&nbsp; The majority of fillings done today are composed of tooth colored resin composite.&nbsp; In addition to looking natural, these resin fillings are bonded to the tooth which provides better retention.</p>

<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Fluoride </span></strong>– Fluoride&nbsp;treatment is necessary and essential for children and adolescents with developing adult dentition.&nbsp; This treatment is usually administered by the dental hygienist or dentist and consists of gently biting into a soft foam tray, lined with a flavored fluoride solution, for just one minute.&nbsp; The patient is instructed not to eat or drink for thirty minutes following the treatment.&nbsp; It is recommended that everyone at or below the age of seventeen have a fluoride treatment every six months.&nbsp; Fluoride is the only element known to man that actually prevents tooth decay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Implants</span></strong> – The dental implant is a titanium post that is surgically placed in the jaw. Most dental implants require a period of approximately 3 months to osseointegrate with the patient’s bone.&nbsp; After this period, an artificial tooth(crown) or teeth is then affixed to the post.&nbsp; Implants are used either as an artificial root or as an anchor for a fixed or removable denture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Anderson has received specialized training for the surgical placement and restoration of dental implants. </p>



<p>There are many benefits of Implants.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are used as a substitute for bridges or dentures. Implants replace single or multiple teeth without having to use other teeth for support.&nbsp; Implants help preserve a patient’s alveolar bone. Implants don’t&nbsp;decay.

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Mini-dental implants</span></strong> – According to the&nbsp;<Link rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/dental-us/procedure/dental-implants/" target="_blank">3M</Link>&nbsp;website,&nbsp;&nbsp;the mini-dental implant system consists of a miniature titanium implant that acts like the root of your tooth. The head of the implant is shaped like a ball and holds the denture in place.&nbsp; When seated, the denture gently rests on the gum tissue.&nbsp; Dr. Anderson is one of the few IMTEC certified dentists in the New Orleans area.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Partials</span></strong> – A&nbsp;partial&nbsp;denture is a removable appliance that is indicated when a patient is missing one or more teeth.&nbsp; A partial is able to stay in the mouth by attaching to other anchor teeth in the same arch.&nbsp; These anchor teeth have to be healthy because they provide the majority of the support for the partial.&nbsp; A traditional partial denture is made of a metal substructure covered by acrylic made to look like natural gums with the teeth set in place.&nbsp; In our office, the majority of the partials are made of a light, translucent, flexible material known as Valplast.  Valplast partials have no metal, therefore, they look more natural when seated in the mouth.&nbsp; A partial denture is the least expensive procedure to replace a missing tooth or teeth.</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Post and Core</span></strong> – A&nbsp;post, in some cases, is a necessary support for a tooth that has had root canal treatment and requires a crown.&nbsp; When there is not enough natural tooth structure available above the gum line, a&nbsp;core&nbsp;build up will serve as the central support on which a crown will rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p className="has-text-align-center"></p>



<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Root Canal Therapy</span></strong> – Root canal therapy is performed on teeth where the nerve has become infected.&nbsp; There are a number of things that may lead to the infection of the nerve of a tooth.&nbsp; Some of them are: a deep cavity, a deep existing filling, a cracked tooth and direct trauma to the tooth. Root canal treatment consists of removing the nerve tissue from the root(s), cleaning and disinfecting the root(s), and then filling and sealing off the root preventing it from becoming infected again.&nbsp; In most cases, a crown is recommended on a tooth that has had root canal treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p className="has-text-align-center"></p>



<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Scaling/Root Planing</span></strong> – Scaling and root planing&nbsp;is also referred to as a “deep cleaning”.&nbsp; This procedure is necessary to remove calcified plaque and build up below the gum line, known as calculus. In most cases, local anesthesia is administered before scaling and root planing is preformed.&nbsp; Patients who require this procedure are recommended to return to the dentist every three months for a periodontal maintenance appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p className="has-text-align-center"></p>



<hr className="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Sealants</span></strong> – Dental sealants are plastic coatings that are usually placed on the chewing surface of the permanent back teeth to help protect them from decay.</p>

<p>TMD&nbsp;is temporomandibular disorder. </p>



<p>In our office we provide a thorough examination to determine if you have TMJ problems.&nbsp; Most of these problems can be treated without having to see a specialist.&nbsp; Many times a simple appliance like a splint or a jaw repositioning appliance can relieve great stress and sometimes pain placed on the tissues surrounding the temporomandibular joint.&nbsp; In more complicated cases, these appliances are used in conjunction with warm compresses, medication and physical therapy.</p>

<p><strong><span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Veneers </span></strong>– Veneers&nbsp;are a very popular and rather conservative cosmetic procedure in dentistry today.&nbsp; A veneer is a thin veil of porcelain which is cemented to the front surface of front teeth.&nbsp; This procedure is conservative because it requires minimal preparation of the teeth by the dentist.&nbsp; Veneers are used to mask teeth that are misaligned, hide gaps between front teeth, and/or cover teeth that have intrinsic stain.&nbsp;</p>
